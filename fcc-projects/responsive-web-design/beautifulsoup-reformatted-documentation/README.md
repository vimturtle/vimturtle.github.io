**Note**: I parsed and reformatted the entire [BS4 documentation website](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) using bs4 itself, a bunch of vim macros, Find/Replace, prettifier, etc and by adding, fixing and removing sections, ids, anchor tags, etc to make FCC tests pass by hand. That's _over 2500_ lines of HTML!! Took me 3 days. Not Recommended.

**DONOT try this at home**. Use a static documentation site generator instead for official projects.
